                <h2>who am i?</h2>
                <p>hi! i'm tina, and i'm here to display my knowledge of basic html + css properties. i have a bachelor of science in biology
                    and i want to transition into programming. i've previously completed harvard's cs50 course, but
                    i decided to also complete appacademy's program to further develop my skills through
                    studying and project building.

                <h2>why cats?</h2>
                <p>i've grown up with dogs my whole life, mostly because that's all that my parents accepted. they did not cats unfortunately,
                    but as i've grown older, i've become very interested in raising a cat (mostly from cat memes).
                    i actually have 1 of my own, a ragamuffin named sora, and now i would like to have a farm full of cats.
                    they're incredibly cute, intelligent, and loving! their personalities are much different from dogs,
                    but taking care of cats fit my lifestyle better. they're just little dudes.

                <h2>disclaimer</h2>
                <p>i am by no means an expert on cats or animals. i purely made this theme because i love learning more
                    about different cat breeds and always trying to be a better caretaker. i hope you can enjoy this silly
                    little page!
